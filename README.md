### Information Architecture

The CV's information architecture is designed following a hierarchical and logical structure that allows users to quickly find the information they are looking for. The design uses an "above the fold" approach to display the most critical information first, followed by complementary content organized in clearly defined sections.

The page begins with a **sticky header** that remains visible during scrolling, containing the main identification (avatar, name, and tagline) along with navigation that allows quick access to any section through anchor links. This horizontal navigation optimizes space and maintains accessibility across all sections.

The main content is organized into **independent sections** contained in visually differentiated cards. Each section serves a specific purpose: **About Me** provides personal and professional context, **Experience** shows work history with chronological details, **Education** presents academic background in timeline format, **Technical Skills** groups competencies into logical categories, **Soft Skills** complements technical abilities, **Languages** highlights linguistic capabilities, and finally **Contact** offers multiple communication methods.

The organization follows a **visual hierarchy** pattern where the most important elements (name, recent experience, main skills) appear first, while complementary information (soft skills, additional details) is placed at the end. Each section uses a consistent spacing system and visual elements such as decorative lines under titles to establish clear separation and visual hierarchy.

The navigation structure is optimized for both quick scanning and detailed reading. Users can jump to specific sections using the sticky navigation menu, or scroll naturally through the content. The card-based layout creates visual breaks that make it easy to digest information in chunks, while maintaining a cohesive overall design.

### Visual Design

The CV's visual design is grounded in modern and minimalist design principles, using a carefully selected color palette that conveys professionalism and trust. The main palette is based on blue tones (#3b82f6, #1d4ed8) as the brand color, which communicates technology and reliability, combined with a light neutral background (#f8fafc) that reduces visual fatigue and dark text (#1e293b) that ensures excellent readability.

The typography uses a strategic combination of **Inter** for body text and interface elements, providing clarity and modernity, while **Merriweather** is reserved for the main name, adding a touch of elegance and differentiation. Font sizes are scaled hierarchically: 36px for the name, 28px for section titles, 20px for subtitles, and 16px for body text, creating a clear visual hierarchy.

The design implements a **card system** with rounded corners (16px radius) and subtle shadows that create depth without being intrusive. Each card uses hover effects that slightly elevate the card and increase the shadow, providing interactive visual feedback. Interactive elements such as contact buttons and skill tags use linear gradients of the brand color, creating an attractive visual effect that maintains consistency with the rest of the design.

Decorative elements include accent lines under section titles, indicator points in the education timeline, and smooth transition effects on all interactive elements. The design is fully responsive, adapting from mobile devices to large desktop screens, maintaining readability and usability across all screen sizes. The color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards, ensuring accessibility for users with visual impairments, while the generous spacing and clear typography enhance readability for all users.
